# Bessel beam simulation
Simulation of a beam propagating through an axicon and diffracting on a plasma nozzle for electron acceleration experiments.
Currently using WPM - Wave Propagation Method.

# Things to be aware of in diffractio
- Refractive index vs. Refraction index
- r0 = (x,y,z) vs. r0 = (y,x,z)
