  GNU nano 6.2                                                                                                      README.md                                                                                                                
# Bessel beam simulation
Simulation of a beam propagating through an axicon and diffracting on a plasma nozzle for electron acceleration experiments.
The code is using WPM - Wave Propagation Method.
Main parts of the project are: simulate.py and analytical_solution.py, the former is used for the actual simulation while the latter
is for comparison purposes, and calculates the intensity field analytically for the cases without any obstacles.

# How to run it
Firstly, you should install the used libraries via  
```
pip install -r /path/to/bessel-beam-simulation/requirements.txt
```
If you use conda, you need to write
```
conda install --yes --file /path/to/bessel-beam-simulation/requirements.txt
```
I highly encourage using a virutal environment for this. diffractio as a library isn't particullary stable, and you don't want to mess up your python installation.

After you installed the libraries you should be ready to go. For simulate.py there is an option to use the argument `--obstacle` or `--no-obstacle` 
to run the simulation with the plasma nozzle.

All constants and parameters used in the simulation are stored in config.json file.

# Things to be aware of in diffractio
- Refractive index vs. Refraction index
- r0 = (x,y,z) vs. r0 = (y,x,z)
